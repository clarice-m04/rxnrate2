## Reaction Kinetics Notebook Report
This Jupyter Notebook presents a detailed report on the development and usage of rxnrate2, a Python package for simulating chemical reaction kinetics. The package models both linear and nonlinear reaction systems by numerically solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based on user-defined reactions and initial conditions.

The notebook includes:

- Background on chemical kinetics and ODE-based modeling

- Examples of linear (matrix-based) and nonlinear (mass-action) systems

- Code snippets demonstrating the use of rxnrate2 functions

- Visualizations of concentration profiles over time

- Integration with Streamlit for interactive exploration (in the full application)

This report serves both as documentation and a guided demonstration of the package's capabilities.
