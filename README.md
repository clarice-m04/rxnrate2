# rxnrate2

Calculates and graphs the way concentrations evolve in a chemical reaction system using ODEs.  
Supports both linear (matrix-based) and nonlinear (mass-action) kinetics, with options for interactive plotting and a Streamlit GUI.

---

## 🔥 Usage

### Linear (first-order) system example

```python
from rxnrate2.linear import build_M_matrix, solve_reaction, plot_solution

M = build_M_matrix([
    ("A", "B", 1.0),
    ("B", "C", 0.5),
    ("C", "B", 0.2),
])
y0 = [0.5, 0.0, 0.0]  # initial concentrations
t_span = (0, 20)

sol = solve_reaction(M, y0, t_span)
plot_solution(sol)
```

### Nonlinear (mass-action) system example

```python
from rxnrate2.nonlinear import solve_reactions, plot_solution

reactions = [
    ("A + B", "C", 1.0),
    ("C", "A + B", 0.5),
    ("C", "A", 0.2),
    ("A + B + C", "D + E", 0.5),
    ("D + E", "A + B + C", 0.5),
]
initial_conc = {"A": 1.0, "B": 1.0, "C": 0.0, "D": 0.0, "E": 0.2}
t_span = (0, 30)

sol = solve_reactions(reactions, initial_conc, t_span)
plot_solution(sol)
```

### GUI

You can also launch the interactive interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 👩‍💻 Installation

Create a new environment (recommended), you may give it any name:

```bash
conda create -n rxnrate2 python=3.10
conda activate rxnrate2
```

Install the package locally:

```bash
pip install .
```

If you're working in a notebook:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

To install full dependencies including the GUI:

```bash
pip install ".[full]"
```

---

## 🛠️ Development Installation

Initialize Git and push to GitHub (only the first time):

> Make sure to create the remote repo at https://github.com/clarice-m04/rxnrate2

```bash
git init
git add * 
git add .*
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:clarice-m04/rxnrate2.git
git push -u origin main
```

Then for editable installs with test and docs support:

```bash
pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
```
